<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — Oh that face, it's even more enthralling when he looks down at us. We must grovel at his feet now!</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Is he getting weird about this? I don't know how to feel about that.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE COLD</b> — I don't know. Maybe his approach could work. But there are plenty of options. All interesting. Except for running. Guaranteed survival? More than most options. But putting off a problem doesn't solve it.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Reinhard isn't a problem to be solved!</p>

<p><blockquote>Subaru's friend group gets even more crowded, especially after he meets a redhead with a sword and a shorthair with a familiar lady. Their reunion is brief but it ends with a real surprise. And then a few more.</blockquote></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Agh!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Emilia!</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You look blankly ahead, your eyes un-</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Collapse to our knees, skin clammy? Yeah. Been there, done that.</p>

<p><b>FRUIT SELLER</b> — Hey! Kid, what's going on?</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — The stall owner's hand reaches out towards you in earnest concern.</p><ul>
    <li class="choice">I-I'm fine. J-just dizzy.</li>
    <li class="choice">O-oh, I think... I-I need to rest. To think.</li>
    <li class="choice">[Get a hold of yourself.]</li>
    <li class="choice-selected">[Start running.]</li>
    <li class="choice">[Collapse again.]</li>
</ul>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You bat the hand away as you pick yourself up. Racing down the street in a mad scramble, you push through a crowd, shoving people to the side. With your plastic bag in hand, you race to god knows where.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You only get a glimpse at the seller's reaction as you leave, a hand to his stomach and a look of confusion and shock pointed in your direction.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Sorry, I'll buy an appa when I have the money!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Despite your hurried departure, you move with surprising swiftness, clambering up a rooftop for a higher vantage, leaving fallen roof tiles in your wake. Your dash continues despite the change in elevation, unlucky pedestrians thankfully spared.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Hey! What the fuck was that back there?</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — I'm a little concerned as well. Are you <i>really</i> fine?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — We are finer than ever, blaggard. And concerned? You should be, now that we are wise to your schemes.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — My... schemes?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — Your efforts to separate us from our most cherished one will never bloom, unlike our love.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Right, so this one is delusional. I can't say these new additions to your mind were expected or seem trustworthy.</p><ul>
    <li class="choice-deselected">They can be trusted. I'd like to think so can you.</li>
    <li class="choice">They can be trusted. Even if you can't be.</li>
    <li class="choice">I trust the annoyed voice. He's stuck by side when I needed him.</li>
    <li class="choice">I don't know about the annoyed voice but this new one is speaking my language! I can't wait to see Emilia again.</li>
    <li class="choice">This is my head, not yours. None of you have been useful enough to earn my trust.</li>
    <li class="choice">I can't trust anyone.</li>
    <li class="choice-selected">This whole thing has been one confusing twist after another, so I'm going to leave the whole trust thing open to revision.</li>
    <li class="choice">[Stop running.]</li>
    <li class="choice">[Focus on running.]</li>
</ul>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Okay, okay. Look.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You come to a halt.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — This whole thing has been one confusing twist after another, so if you don't mind, I'm just going to put as much trust in all of you as is like normal for whenever everything is blowing up in my face, right?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — So, I mostly trust you guys. Or at least that you all mean well, even if I'm pretty sure you all know as little as I do, if not less.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Still haven't explained exactly what we were doing <b>bleeding out on the ground</b>.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Bleeding out?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Shut it, wasn't talking to you.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Okay, okay you guys. I 'll explain once we find a more private place to talk.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Yes, the rooftops aren't exactly the most inconspicuous choice. Not to mention the fact that you're talking out loud, I thought I told you not to do that.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Well now you've mentioned it.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Whoops.</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Okay, do you at least know where you're going? Why are you running off without any prompting?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — We race to save our love, the beau of the moonlit sky, and the woman of silver who captured our hearts.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — Oh my love, ne'er again should you have to bear the slings and arrows of outrageous torment!</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Yeah, uh no. Well, maybe if she can help with getting us out of this shitty level.</p><ul>
    <li class="choice-selected">I'm with The Smitten on this, we need to save her this time.</li>
    <li class="choice">I'm with The Cheated on this, we'll need her help to get us out of this situation.</li>
    <li class="choice">I'm with The Cheated on this, we'll need to find a way out of this.</li>
    <li class="choice">I'm still looking for that damn Princess, whoever she is.</li>
    <li class="choice">Can we just keep on running? At some point, we've got to be out of the splash zone of death.</li>
    <li class="choice-deselected">Actually, why am I running? [Find a place to REALLY think.]</li>
    <li class="choice">[Get back to running.]</li>
</ul>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>I'm with the Voice of the Smitten on this, we need to save her this time. I... I don't want to see her die, ever again.</i></p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — We barely knew her, and her healing was rubbish.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — Her tender hands gave us the strength we needed to defend her!</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Didn't do her any good in the end did it?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — No! We have been put in this world to protect her from death once more. It is because of her that we stand here again.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>I mean, she was very pretty and very kind but I don't think I'd like it very much if she was the cause for me having to die twice.</i></p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Because of her? How does that even make sense? She's just some girl.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Yes, how does that make sense? This is your first time here. Not to mention, if you're running you should be running to slay the Princess.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Oh shut it.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — It makes sense to my heart. And that is all that matters.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Is it? I would imagine the world not ending to matter quite a bit.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — The end of the world cannot compare to the end of our love.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Hold on, new guy! You're going a little too far there. I'd like it if the world were around for us to be around her.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — This conversation is a waste of time. She won't even remember you, remember?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Ah.</p><ul>
    <li class="choice">I'm doing this because it's right, not because I need her to remember.</li>
    <li class="choice-selected">But I'll still remember.</li>
    <li class="choice-deselected">That's a good point. Is it not too late to change my mind?</li>
    <li class="choice">[Don't respond.]</li>
</ul>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — But I'll still remember.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Even if she forgets, I can't just forget about her. Especially not if she's headed for the same bad end again.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — Well said!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Moving on from this collective delusion:</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You continue your run across the city's skyline. The sky is without a cloud and you can feel the warmth on the sun against your back.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — From here, you can see behind you is a tall castle at the center, and radiating outward is the first of the city's stone walls.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — They separate the higher echelons of the city from the lower classes. Various cities walls after that separate the rest of the city into further sections.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — From where you are now, given all the stalls and cheap goods being sold, you're probably closer to the lower classes though not quite at the city's margins.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — A lore dump! He's finally doing his job.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Huh, do we know the name of the city?</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — That's not really relevant to your quest is it?</p><ul>
      <li class="choice">[Press Him on this point.]</li>
      <li class="choice-selected">[Focus on running.]</li>
</ul>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — I guess not.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You continue your trip through the city, leaping from building to building with an ease that speaks of practice.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Not any practice I remember but I won't complain if I'm being tossed more level-ups.</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You can hear the faint sound of a child crying as you run. You glance at the crowd of market-goers who, unlike you, fail to notice a lost-looking little girl, hunched in on herself with her back against the wall.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Her eyes dart back and forth across the many passers-by.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — We are NOT doing an escort quest.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — Time away from our beloved is time wasted, but if it might please her to know we were kind then kind we must be.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — We could even present this child to her! I am sure the sounds of a child's laughter would only please her.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — We are ALSO not doing an collection quest.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Please don't go around kidnapping children. It's only another detour and that girl is as good as dead anyway if you don't slay the Princess.</p><ul>
      <li class="choice-selected">[Go help the kid.]</li>
      <li class="choice">[Pick up the kid.]</li>
      <li class="choice">[Get back to running.]</li>
</ul>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Hey, kid!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — As you drop from the sky, she turns to face you a look of anticipation on her face. But it falls; you weren't who she was hoping for. Disappointment gives way as she bursts into tears.</p>

<p><b>LOST CHILD</b> — D-don't eat me!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Man, I really do look scary don't I? More than usual even.</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Nah, you're too small for me to eat. Like this coin.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You pull out a coin with more drama than it deserves. The girl looks on wide-eyed, further tears subsiding.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — This isn't just any coin, it's a grooved-edge ten-yen coin. It's so special and it's so small like you that... it disappears!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Now where could such a special coin go? Why, maybe it's right where we'd never expect!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — In one quick move, you reach behind the girl's ear and pull out the coin.</p>

<p><b>LOST CHILD</b> — A-ah.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — She clutches her stomach, as if she had eaten something terrible but it only now caught up with her.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Tada! Uh, hey are you okay?</p>

<p><b>LOST CHILD</b> — O-oh-key?</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — She backs up away from you, her feet sending her stumbling into a wall. You follow with an outstretched arm.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — H-hey I've got y-</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — That stops once a demihuman runs over and picks the little girl up. She holds the little one against her chest with tight knuckles and bent knees.</p>

<p><b>GRAY DEMIHUMAN</b> — Stay away from the kid, boy!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — A crowd around the two of you had begun to form when you landed on the ground. Your demonstration along with the girl's ill reaction have only gathered more eyes.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — H-hold on, I was just trying to calm her down!</p>

<p><b>YELLOW HAIRED WOMAN</b> — By giving the poor girl a fright?</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — She does seem to be unwell in a different way now.</p>

<p><b>LIZARD DEMIHUMAN</b> — Flowery freak! Don't touch her!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — F-flowery?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — I think we're done here.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — Ungrateful curs!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — With that, you run away, leaping to higher ground. The ire of the crowd isn't worth it.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — They didn't even notice her until they noticed me! They just decided I was bad news. Ugh, at least they might be able to help her.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Waste of time, like I said.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Continuing your dash for a few minutes longer, air whistling by, you eventually skid to a sudden stop. Dropping off a rooftop to land in the middle of a narrow but unremarkable side street, you take a deep breath before looking around.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — The side street is humid and constrained, a lone beam of sunlight at its end beckons you to move forward.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Like the stall and the child, this is just-</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Another detour?</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Yes. Listen to me, you need to-</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — No, no. We end up here every time. If it's a detour, which I'm pretty sure it isn't, it's a necessary one.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — <i>Every</i> time? This is-</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Heck, we can't seem to avoid this place at all... but it's as good a place as any to think. And talk.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — I think it's time I got my head screwed on right!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Sigh.</p><ul>
    <li class="choice-selected">So let me explain what happened before I died.</li>
    <li class="choice">That voice... the person who killed me the second time was the same one who passed me by in the street. Could she have been the Princess?</li>
    <li class="choice">Emilia... she had the looks, and the voice, and the kind of atmosphere that just screams fantasy world. Could she have been the Princess?</li>
    <li class="choice-deselected">Is there really any Princess?</li>
    <li class="choice">I can't believe I did all that parkour... did I level up again?</li>
    <li class="choice-deselected">...you know, there's a suspicious lack of UI. And my quest giver doesn't seem to know what's going on. Am I leveling up or is there something else going on?</li>
    <li class="choice">We checked the mirror last time and I looked different. I don't really feel cold anymore, so maybe I'm back to normal? Doesn't explain the "flowery freak" thing though.</li>
    <li class="choice-deselected">Hold on, there's a new voice in my head? Isn't it getting kind of crowded here?</li>
    <li class="choice">[Examine the mirror.]</li>
    <li class="choice">[Go back to the main road.]</li>
    <li class="choice">[Continue down the side street.]</li>
</ul>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — So, new guy, you up to date on the happenings and going-ons?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — He knows what I know. Which is to say, not enough.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — I know enough and more! All we need to trust is in her beauty.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Emilia?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — Yes, our beloved! Hers are the only words we need follow.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — That's her name? Hm, it's nice. We didn't really share that many words with her though.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Wow, I forgot you missed out on that part. She was practically sparkling in the moonlight!</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — Indeed, our Princess need not speak, for her beauty speaks louder than any words.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Your <i>Princess?</i> Not <i>a</i> princess but <i>the</i> Princess? That's impossible, you've not met any princesses since coming into this world and most certainly not <i>the</i> Princess.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — You really still don't remember?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Wouldn't matter even if he did. He's not going to be useful even <i>if</i> he believed us.</p><ul>

</ul>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — That sultry voice... I know the person who killed me the second time was the same one who passed me by in the street and she was in the same place as where the blizzard came from. Could that have been her the first time too? Could she have been the Princess?</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You're concocting some very detailed delusions. If she was the Princess and out and about, the world would have ended.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — Our beloved was out and about when she discovered us and the world hardly looked any worse for wear than it did before. If anything, her presence only made it shine all the more.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — You know, you're absolutely right about Emilia, though I think no matter how bright the rest of the world shine it won't compare to her!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — That said, I don't know if she's the Princess? I really, really hope she isn't. The last thing I want is to slay her.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — We won't! That tall tales of His isn't to be trusted.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — I don't know... he's been wrong on many counts before but the one thing he's been right about is the world ending.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — I'd rather the world end than live in one without <i>love</i>.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Are you hearing this? I think it's clear these delusional voices have influenced you too much and too quickly if you're seriously entertaining the thoughts of someone who's okay with the world ending.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — I think it's clear it's not worth talking to either of them. Let's just figure out our plan for this run so we can put a <i>ice pick</i> through the Princess' head sooner.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — What!?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — I'm not talking about <i>silver bells</i>. She's not the Princess. The Princess was the one with the sultry voice.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — She even survived our ice magic in the last go-around, which explains how she made that blizzard in our first run, she's a mage too.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — That vixen is no Princess. She was crude and sadistic.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — And that fits our profile, she's killed us twice, both making it as painful as possible. Her being not being sadistic would be a surprise.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Not to cut in, but I don't think we know enough to decide if either of them are the Princess... though Emilia definitely looks the part of a princess, I don't think she's the world ending type.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — As for the other one, she could be the Princess but if so, then why'd she go and cut us open?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — What do you mean? She freezes us, we die. She cuts us open, we die. Different choices, same outcome.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — But she changed how she killed us. If she's a mage, someone who'd kill us from across the city, then why attack us up close?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — So? What're you saying?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — I'm not saying anything! I just don't think we know enough yet...</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — ...</p><ul>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — How about we check the mirror? I don't really feel cold anymore, so maybe I'm back to normal?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — That doesn't explain the "flowery freak" thing though.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — The mirror? There's no mirror here.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — I-</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Don't even think about answering that. Now, that mirror?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Right, the mirror is-</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — ...</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — Well? Do we look dashing?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — ...the mirror is gone.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — What!? Then how will we groom ourselves?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Nothing important lost. We can spend as much time looking at ourselves as we please after we get out of this scenario.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Maybe it wasn't there because you haven't actually been here before.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Okay, okay! We get it, you don't believe us. It's just like last time.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — But let me make a prediction: one that is impossible to predict otherwise!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — In a few minutes, three thugs are going to walk into this alleyway to corner us. One of them will be named <b>Moe</b> while the other two will be be named <b>Dumb</b> and <b>Dumber</b>!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Would that be proof enough for you?</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — ...those are some terrible names. Look, you can dream up whatever scenario you want but the fact remains that the way to the Princess isn't this way and not going to the Princess means damning my world to oblivion.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Oh don't worry, we're stopping that Princess. Or whoever it is that froze everything the first time.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — I won't rest until then if my name isn't Natsuki Subaru!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — ...or rather I can't rest until I know Emilia's safe. And me too.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — As long as we are together with her, all will be alright! The world be damned.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — I wouldn't go that far but I thought that the first half of that sentence went without saying! Her and me were practically attached by the hip.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — I leave for a few minutes and you've made your whole personality one woman. Well, let's hope she pulls her weight this time.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — The time for questions subside as three shadows from the other end of the side road approach.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — You were right about them being a compulsory event. They stick to us like fleas. All the more reason to stomp them out.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — To rid ourselves and our love of these vermin, it's only becoming of us to act as heroes even without witnesses. Yes, let us stamp them out!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — No one is stomping or stamping anyone, okay?!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — They draw near, blocking your exit towards the main road.</p>

<p><b>MOE</b> — What the hell is this guy babbling about?</p>

<p><b>DUMBEST</b> — He doesn't get what's going on here.</p>

<p><b>DUMBER</b> — That so? Then here's your lesson: if you don't wanna get hurt, cough up everything you've got!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — They're commenting on the fact that you forgot to think instead of talking aloud. Wait, Dumber? What are these names?</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — ...oh.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <b>Moe</b>, <b>Dumber</b>, and <b>Dumbest</b>. Like I said.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — ...I don't want to believe it, or perhaps I can't. But this isn't the first time you've been here, has it?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — He believes us!</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — What happened to the hardball he'd been playing across literal time and space?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Hey, I'll take Him turning on a dime over Him just being a stubborn loser. That's just tsunderes for you.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — As <i>the</i> expert on love here, I don't believe he has any amount of dere to tsun.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Just... answer the question, please.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — This is our... third time here? We died twice.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Two times...</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — That almost seems like too few for things to be this out of wack.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Ideally, this was supposed to be one-and-done. You slay the Princess and save the world. Dying wasn't a part of the equation. That's two whole worlds damned to oblivion.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — You said something like that last time too, even if you didn't believe us. Look what good that did.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Not part of the equation? And what do you mean out of wack?</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — What's happening here is a second, or well, third shot at things. A contingency.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You being here is going to make things worse. But I've already said too much, I'll just make things worse.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — I don't think it'd hurt to know more, I mean I died like a dog the first time because I didn't know anything!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Believe me when I say this: the less you know, the better this goes for everyone.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — So basically, you're still not going to give us anything we don't already know. Like I said, it's not worth listening to Him.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — On that, we agree!</p>

<p><b>DUMBER</b> — Man, he's even crazier up close.</p>

<p><b>DUMBEST</b> — Crazy or not, if he doesn't pay up he's asking for it!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — We can unpack the matter of my utility later, try not to forget the threat in front of you and do something.</p><ul>

<p><b>DUMBER</b> — Hard way it is!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — The thug, wearing a toothy grin, winds up a punch.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You don't see it coming but you do feel it. The knuckles crack, skin against skin, bone against bone. It's not a well-practiced blow but it hurts nonetheless.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Ack!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — The thug lets go of you and you fall to the ground.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Tutorial mobs! We're getting trounced by tutorial mobs!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — And yet, inexplicably, the thug falls too.</p>

<p><b>DUMB</b> — <b>Rachins</b>?</p>

<p><b>RACHINS</b> — ...a-</p>

<p>THE NARRATOR — The thug, prone on the ground, lets loose a wretched cry.</p>

<p><b>RACHINS</b> — AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH-</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — His hands grab towards the sky, as if there were something out there could help him, and his eyes meet yours. But your eyes draw lower, as you stare at his gaping mouth and his-</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>-frozen tongue.</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Then, with a final pathetic wheeze, his meager resistance gives out. He can scream no more.</p>

<p><b>DUMB</b> — Rachins!</p>

<p><b>MOE</b> — W-what did you do to him?!</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — Nothing he did not deserve!</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Nothing you won't get to learn firsthand.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>U-uh, h-he's... he's dead.</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Again.</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>He died just by touching me this time.</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Again.</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>I didn't even do anything and he died.</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>I didn't even do <b>anything</b>.</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Without intending to, your face twists into a scowl as you think. Your hand balls upon into a fist.</p>

<p><b>DUMB</b> — H-hey, we don't mean no harm. W-we're just gonna go.</p>

<p><b>MOE</b> — Y-yeah. L-look! I even left your stuff on the floor, no foul!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — The two remaining thugs begin to back away.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Oh hell no. Don't let them leave!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Your balled fists tighten until your skin stretches a canvas over the knuckles.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — You two.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — They freeze.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Do you all have a death wish? How do you keep getting yourselves killed by me of all people?!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — The thugs look on helpless and bewildered as you rant and rave like a lunatic.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Why are you even muggers in a world where people can throw around magic willy-nilly!? Do you want to die? Is that why you keep making me kill you?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Not to mention, your friend over there? He died just from touching me! I didn't even do anything!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Their eyes don't follow where you're pointing. Seeing their presumed friend dead might be a bit much for their stomachs.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — You can't blame me if you're so fragile that you keel over just from a little contact. We've been past swine flu for years, you shouldn't need social distancing!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — The two thugs cap off your speech by falling to the ground and prostrating themselves.</p>

<p><b>DUMB</b> — P-please don't kill us. Whatever you want, just don't kill us!</p>

<p><b>MOE</b> — Y-yeah, what he said! Whatever <i>swine flu</i> or <i>social distancing</i> is, we'll do it! We're at your mercy boss!</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Wow.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — I believe they've gotten the point. Let us waste no time more without our beloved by our side.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>This is more of a reaction than I expected but if it works, it works.</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — If I've made myself clear, I'll be leaving. It's time you learnt to-</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — A voice, young, shouts from one end of the entrance of the alleyway. Hurried footsteps follow.</p>

<p><b>STREET RAT</b> — Move it, move it! Move it you guys, hurry! Out of my way!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — A young girl sprints through the side street, before slowing to a stop before the site of your confrontation. Just as quickly as they chose to beg, they turn on you.</p>

<p><b>MOE</b> — H-hey! Call for help, this guy's insane!</p>

<p><b>STREET RAT</b> — Hm?</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — She takes one look at you.</p>

<p><b>STREET RAT</b> — He sure looks like it. I'm busy right now though so, sorry! Live strong!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — She dashes right on through, leaping from wall to wall before landing upon and then running across the rooftops.</p>

<p><b>DUMB</b> — ...<b>Camberly</b> that was stupid as hell.</p>

<p><b>CAMBERLY</b> — Why would you let him know my name!?</p>

<p><b>DUMB</b> — Why would that matter!? You just tried to sell him out to the guards, we're not gonna survive long enough for your name to matter!</p>

<p><b>CAMBERLY</b> — My name doesn't matter? Fine! Gaston, Gaston. You're name is <b>Gaston</b>!</p>

<p><b>GASTON</b> — Oh real mature, Rachins is dead so now you take it out on me.</p>

<p><b>CAMBERLY</b> — If you don't like me taking it out on you, then shut up!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Both of you!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Their heads swivel towards you so fast you hear a crack.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — I'm leaving now. Go turn yourselves in to the police or guards or whatever.</p>

<p><b>CAMBERLY</b> — C-can do boss! Ow...</p>

<p><b>GASTON</b> — W-will do! Ouch...</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You leave the kneeling ruffians behind at last, about to continue down the side street when another voice appears.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — It is a powerful and authoritative voice, filled with not a projected strength but an easy confidence that cannot be hidden. This man speaks with a strength that few, if any, can match.</p>

<p><span class="red"><b>PILLAR OF FLAME</b></span> — That's enough.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Blindingly bright, with fiery red hair and eyes the color of the sky, stands an intensely attractive man. But his looks belie the muscled frame beneath his white clothing and scabbard.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — By the <i>gods</i>. If we did not have our beloved already then I might've fallen in love right here and now.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — That smug aura and perfect face. <i>Tch.</i> I can hear the boss music already.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — I can't say I disagree with either of you right now... he gives off crazy strong vibes.</p>

<p><b>GASTON</b> — T-that red hair! A-and a knight's sword with scratches made by dragon's claws...</p>

<p><b>GASTON</b> — Could that be... Reinhard? The master swordsman?</p>

<p><b>CAMBERLY</b> — W-we're saved!</p>

<p><b>REINHARD</b> — Looks like I don't need to introduce myself.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — He takes a look at Rachins' body and then at you. He speaks calmly, without a hint of tension, in stark contrast to you.</p>

<p><b>REINHARD</b> — Were you the one responsible for the death of this man?</p><ul>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You pause.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>...who died all of a sudden?</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Hold on, if me touching him was enough to kill him, does that mean...</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>O-oh.</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — The thought is enough to make you freeze.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>T-that kid!</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You recollect how she held her stomach, clearly uncomfortable and stumbling.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>T-the appa guy!</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — That same gesture and a flash of recognition in your eyes-</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — They bled out.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Just like me in the loot house.</i></p>

<p><b>REINHARD VAN ASTREA</b> — They?</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — He seems to pick up that you're not talking about the thug. You meet his judging gaze with your own.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Y'know...</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Your heart is racing and your breathing is uneven. Your sweat is clinging to the back of your neck.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>More than his terrifying strength, there's something else I feel about this guy.</i></p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — His overwhelmingly ideal looks?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — The immense smug confidence he exudes?</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — The fact that your mind apparently named him off of his voice as <span class="red">PILLAR OF FIRE?</span></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Well, yes all of those, but also doesn't he just seem like a nice guy? Also, the fire thing wasn't you?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — He is <i>threatening</i> us.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — He's questioning you, he hasn't yet made up his mind. I'd suggest making up yours now however, he's clearly waiting for your answer. And no, I did not decide to name him <span class="red">PILLAR OF FIRE</span>.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>I'll just... try and explain it like how it happened. I know from experience with explaining to teachers the stuff I got up to back in middle school that if you say too much, they'll assume you're guilty!</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Though I guess I am.</p>

<p><b>REINHARD VAN ASTREA</b> — Hm?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — It's nothing. You asked if I killed him?</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You speak factually. It's the tone of someone giving a report on something they heard about, not something they did.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — He punched me in the face, right here, and then died on the spot.</p>

<p><b>REINHARD VAN ASTREA</b> — So you were assaulted?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Yes. He and the other two were trying to rob me. I just stood there and took it but he hit me and then... that happened.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You eyes dart to the frozen thug, Rachins. The redheaded knight's eyes follow. </p>

<p><b>REINHARD VAN ASTREA</b> — I see.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Rather unaffected sort isn't he.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Whether he's putting up a strong front like you, is yet to be seen.</p>

<p><b>REINHARD VAN ASTREA</b> — Is this something new to you?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — If you're asking me if people dropping like flies when they touch me is new too me, then the answer is obviously yes right?!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — How could anyone live with such a monstrous power without, I dunno, moving to a cabin in the middle of a forest?</p>

<p><b>REINHARD VAN ASTREA</b> — ...I can say with certainty such a person like that would struggle to get along with others.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — He looks down for a moment, perhaps recalling something, before facing you again. A free hand hovers over the sword at his hip.</p>

<p><b>REINHARD VAN ASTREA</b> — Based on what you've told me, you are technically responsible for this man's death.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You gulp. But he smiles for the first time since your conversation began.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — S-so bright!</p>

<p><b>REINHARD VAN ASTREA</b> — But I can tell you're not up to no good based on my Divine Protection of Doubt. And if I've understood this correctly, you didn't intend to kill this man.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Exactly! I... I really don't want to hurt anyone. Not any more than I already have.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Heck, I could barely do anything the last time I... accidentally killed someone. Now I've gotten Rachins and probably the appa guy and the kid dead!</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>I should be sobbing mess by now, but all I feel is... annoyed more than anything else. Shocked too but... isn't this a lot less than what I should be feeling? Am I such a disgusting person that I got over killing this quickly?</i></p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — Nonsense. The depths of our passions of joy are unstiflable and but our sorrows, oh our passions of sorrow run deeper than the ocean. But we mustn't shed tears until we are reunited with our beloved, the fairest creature in all of creation, for hers is the only life that truly matters.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Uh that's a little-</p>

<p><b>REINHARD VAN ASTREA</b> — This <i>condition</i> of yours is something recent?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Oh uh, first can I ask?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — What's a Divine Protection?</p>

<p><b>REINHARD VAN ASTREA</b> — Abilities some people are born with. I possess more than the average person.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Let me guess, He didn't know about this either.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — I know enough, or at least I thought I did. If the world has changed as much as it did then the influence of the Princess must be spreading.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — Her beauty is being spread across the world? How wonderful!</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — <i>Great.</i> So now she's even changing things between retries. At least we've got a 1-hit KO now. Changing the city won't help her if she's dead.</p>

<p><b>REINHARD VAN ASTREA</b> — Hello?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Oh, uh, sorry. I just spaced out. And yeah, uh, this is new to me to.</p>

<p><b>REINHARD VAN ASTREA</b> — I see. Then please, if you come with me then I am sure I could help  with said condition.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — He... holds out his hand towards you, as if asking you to take it.</p>

<p><b>CAMBERLY</b> — W-wait, don't!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — W-what the heck are you doing?!</p>

<p><b>REINHARD VAN ASTREA</b> — Is taking my hand such a disagreeable idea?</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — He genuinely looks hurt by your refusal. Big doe eyes and all.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — His eyes... no, we have our Princess! I won't be swayed!</p>

<p><b>GASTON</b> — Even the freak arguing against it!</p>

<p><b>REINHARD VAN ASTREA</b> — Do not worry. I will not die.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — He speaks with something beyond mere confidence or arrogance. He talks as if he is explaining that 2 + 2 will always equal 4. The possibility of his death isn't even a glimmer in his mind.</p><ul>

<p><b>REINHARD VAN ASTREA</b> — It'd be safer if we knew ahead of time if I can hold you.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — That just makes me more nervous! What do you mean I won't have any options if we can't touch!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — And what's with that attitude towards your own life huh?! Don't just go sacrificing yourself for the first person you meet in an alleyway!</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — I'm leaning towards <i>fuck us over</i> here.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — I get that you're still concerned about... all this. I mean-</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Your eyes draw once more towards Rachins and you can feel... sweat flow down your cheek? No, it's dew. How odd.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Well, no matter. You strike a dramatic, if campy, pose as you point towards the air and jut your hips.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — But! I promise you on my family's name and honor, I, Natsuki Subaru, do pledge to do no harm, uh, no more harm, to anyone.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — You won't have to worry, I'll be social distancing the whole way.</p>

<p><b>REINHARD VAN ASTREA</b> — ...very well, if you insist so strongly, I cannot force myself upon you.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — His stance slackens.</p>

<p><b>REINHARD VAN ASTREA</b> — I'll bring you to my home then for now. You appear quite tired.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Ah. He's right. I've been running on early morning adrenaline since two deaths ago. Time loop or not, I'm just about done with the past few days!</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>I guess that makes me kind of pathetic for somehow getting tired when everything just resets anyway.</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Yeah, you said you're bringing me home? Man, you should leave those kind of lines for girls! You're gonna make me blush.</p>

<p><b>REINHARD VAN ASTREA</b> — I don't see the difference between men and women in this instance. I am happy to have you irregardless.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — As a guest, he means.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — We understood that!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — ...man I really am blushing now.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Okay, point the w-</p>

<p><b>REINHARD VAN ASTREA</b> — My apologies.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You blink.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — In the span of that time, his hand goes from relaxed at his side to touching your forehead. Whatever he was trying to do, he doesn't accomplish it. As his fingers brush against your skin, his body stiffens and he falls to the ground.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — Wait! No! What do you think you're doing?</p>

<p><b>REINHARD VAN ASTREA</b> — Ah.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>No!</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — There's no terror in his features, just eyes wider and more sincere than before, an acknowledgement of what is happening to him. His skin turns pale and his hair, bright as it is, becomes snowladen and dull. He turns to you and smiles with the same confidence he had moments ago, as if it were you and not him who were dying and he wanted to give you one last bit of solace.</p>

<p><b>REINHARD VAN ASTREA</b> — Don't worry.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — And then he stops moving, his face frozen in eternal consoling. He is dead.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — ...the fuck what was that? He tried to touch us anyway? What was the point of that?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — He... he shouldn't have died, no, no!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — A-and yet... he's dead. Oh. O-oh no. </p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — D-damnit! T-this is my fault. I-I can't be around other people. Not now, not ever!</p>

<p><b>CAMBERLY</b> — Oh fuck, oh fuck, he fucked Reinhard, he fucking fucked-</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — The larger thug picks up the diminutive one and tucks him under his armpit as if he were carrying luggage.</p>

<p><b>GASTON</b> — We're out of here!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — They run. You don't move to intercept.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — And we let them get away. <i>Fucking</i> great.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — I-I think I'm going to be sick.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — Sick?! We took part in the murder of the moon to our sun, a beauty second to only our Princess, and a man whose selflessness knew no limits; and you merely feel sick? I, for one, am absolutely distraught. Grief-stricken. Inconsolable!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Yes, it was a rather meaningless death wasn't it.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — We might as well end it now.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You raise your hand over to your chest, hovering it over where your heart would be. Then ice magic begins to swirl in your palm, aimed directly at— excuse me?! No, you absolutely do not do that.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — W-wait! But I-I'm not doing this? What's going on?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — No, no, no, no, no! Stop that. Stop it. We're already getting sabotaged by the game, we don't need self-sabotage on top of that!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — S-sabotage? This is s-suicide! I-I...</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — I-I guess. It's b-better than letting him die in vain.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>I'd never have the guts to do this, even if I know I'm coming back.</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>...will I come back? Or could there be a limit? Either way, I'm glad. I can save someone this way. Even if it's from my own pathetic self.</i></p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — Indeed, this is the only thing left to do.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Fuck no, did you two forget we're supposed to be trying to stay alive?!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Yes, listen to that voice. Don't throw away your life just because someone made a rash decision.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — And uh, what about Emilia, what about her? Are you going to abandon her now?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — Emilia. She... oh, I miss her. My heart yearns for her so deeply, this gash that our heinous act left on our heart it...</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Your hand still swirls with unstable, wintry energy, a mountain in your palm, on the cusp of an avalanche.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Smitten?</i></p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — I... think we should-</p>

<p><b>EMILIA</b> — Don't!</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Speak of the devil.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You turn to face the new arrival. A woman with silver hair stands, hand outstretched towards you. Beside her, floating mid-air, is a grey-haired cat.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Emilia!</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — Our beloved!</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — A floating cat? What?</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Instinctively, you raise your hand towards her. To wave? To match her own outstretched hand? It doesn't matter.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Either way, that magic you had in your palm burst outwards and impales the young woman on a spear of ice spanning the entire side street.</p>

<p><b>FLOATING FELINE</b> — Lia!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — The creature flies to the woman's side in an instant, meeting her entry wound with a cooling glow.</p>

<p><b>FLOATING FELINE</b> — Stay with me, stay with me!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — ...what?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>...Emilia? Why are you... w-why are you-!</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — A shrill silent sound in your skull nearly shatters your eardrums.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — What?!</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Think that was the other guy.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — Our dear, our beloved, the fairest creature in all the lands, a sun that would never set, a rose... a rose that wilts, a star that falls to the ground, a beautiful fawn hunted and butchered and- t-this.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — This is too much. There is nothing, nothing left for us. She was the last good thing in this world or the next.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Oh, Smitten. I-</p>

<p><b>FLOATING FELINE</b> — You scum.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — The grey-haired cat turns from the woman, his attempt to resuscitate her having failed, towards you. He summons his own spears of ice, floating in midair poised to-</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — All of you. All of you! You thought me stiflable but now, now! My sorrow burns hotter than a volcano and my rage is colder than ice. Have at you! Have at you all!</p>

<p><b>FLOATING FELINE</b> — What do you think you're doing to my daugher?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Oh no you don't!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Daughter? No, wait, w-wait! E-Emilia, I-</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — The feline sends-</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Give me those controls, you can't-</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — No more, no more! I know that-</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — There's too much going, I can't tell left-</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — -ice towards you aimed to-</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — -kill us, we're not fucking-</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — -dying won't redeem us but there is nothing left- </p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — -from right! Why... why is Emilia-!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Amidst a cascade of voices in your mind, the very direct threat of a barrage of icicle missiles is sent flying your way. They pierce through your arms and legs, sending you crashing into a wall.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Ack!</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You don't die instantly, in fact the choice of targeting your limbs appears to be to either disable you or to lengthen your suffering. You're left a scarecrow, icicles making a makeshift clothes hanger from which you are dangling from. It's almost reminiscent of a crucifix.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>It hurts, it hurts!</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — One of your arms attempts to forcibly wrench itself out of the icicle impaling it. But bone catches on the rough and sharp edges of the projectile and only helps to widen the hole in your limb. Even so, it works with a manic pace, jerking back and forth to try and free itself. It fails again and again, only widening the wound. It gushes with blood.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Stop it, you're making it worse! Fuck, we need a plan!</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — Let me die. Please. There's nothing worth living for in a world without her.</p>

<p><b>FLOATING FELINE</b> — Struggling? That's cute.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — A burst of freezing cold wind blasts you in the face, leaving your lips frozen tight. Your eyes nearly freeze shut but you can see the silhouette of a giant creature where the floating cat once was. Its foot alone is large enough to crush you and the surrounding buildings, towering above the skyline.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — It is a <b>Behemoth</b>.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Just shut up and let me think! Whose side are you?!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — What do you think I can do here? I'm no more able to stop this than you.</p>

<p><b>BEHEMOTH</b> — But that won't save you.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — The winds pick up strength. You can no longer feel your toes, your fingers. Your nostrils burn.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — ...goddammit.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Oh.</i></p>

<p><b>BEHEMOTH</b> — Sleep.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You can barely make anything out in the endless white that swallows every sense. A distant scream, a flash of light, and the eyes of the behemoth that look back at you.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>No, that's not a behemoth.</i></p>

<p><b>BEHEMOTH</b> — Along with my daughter.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — The world spins and spins and rises up above except, the world hasn't moved at all. Your neck froze and broke in two, sending your head falling to the ground. There are only seconds left.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>It's the <b>Blizzard</b>. He killed me. The first time.</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — The last thing you see before all the world disappears is a flash of red and the sound of a sword being drawn. A battle.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — I'll be with you, in one world or another my love.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — But you don't get to see it play out because everything goes dark, and you die.</p></div><div class="chapter preface group">

    <h3 class="heading">Notes:</h3>

<p>Hello again! Hope this chapter wasn't too much of a downer. But in the meantime, let me share some thoughts on this chapters, specifically on two voices.</p>

<p>The dynamic between <b>Smitten</b> and <b>Cheated</b> was one I wanted to get right in this chapter but they only ever appear in the same chapter in Slay the Princess three times. Keep in mind, two of those three times are The Moment of Clarity and the different Chapters 3 and 4 after The Razor.</p>

<p>That means the only time that they uniquely show up together, without it being the full ensemble, is in one route: The Thorn. I never actually got to The Thorn before this chapter so I had to go and play the game again. I ended up deleting all my old saves (backed them up in a zip file though because it's got my first run in there, and that's special because that's all my real choices) because I didn't want to continue from an old save and also because I didn't have access to the gallery from the Pristine Cut for whatever reason and deleting my data fixed that.</p>

<p>Anyways, I hope you enjoyed that chapter! See you in 2-3 weeks!</p><div>

</p><div class="story-body">

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — The side street is humid and constrained, a lone beam of sunlight at its end beckons you to— wait, excuse me?! What just happened? What did you do?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — So that cat with Emilia was the source of that blizzard... I feel... I feel dizzy.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Ohohoho. I guess I took us to the alleyway, didn't I? Isn't <i>that</i> interesting. Who holds the cards now?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE COLD</b> — Good job. That means we're making progress. Killing the Princess will be easier.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — You- you!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Inside voice! Ugh, my head.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — ...I do not like that one. Let us go and find our beloved once more so we may throw ourselves at her feet, begging for forgiveness.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Great. So you've obviously already been here. How many times?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — This is our fourth?</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — No wonder things have fallen apart. You do realize that every time you fail, she escapes and an entire world is damned to destruction, right?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — We know. Some of us are trying to not die here.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE PARANOID</b> — Not all of us. We're in a ship mid-mutiny and without any land in sight.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE COLD</b> — Well, there's no use in standing around if that's the case is there? Shall we get a move open?</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You look around the side street. It is a tight space, incredibly so. You don't think two people could walk by each other without bumping into one another here. The walls of the buildings next to you stretch a half a dozen stories high.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Is this what it feels like to be an ant stuck in a crack?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE COLD</b> — It's changed. Interesting. I wonder if anything else has changed.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE PARANOID</b> — Who's doing this? How? What do they get out of doing this to us?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Doesn't matter. We've been leveling up for the past while, a change in the level layout is just the kind of bullshit this game would want to throw at us when we're already stuck at this checkpoint. Can't get too many good things tossed our way.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — The influence of the Princess is spreading. You need to hurry and slay her <b>now</b>.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE COLD</b> — And yet we still do not know who exactly the Princess is. We've certainly killed or seen the silver woman be killed enough times to tell she's not the Princess.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE COLD</b> — Though, I suppose it doesn't matter. We might as well kill her for all the effort it takes.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — You are a sick, sick creature. Lower than worms and dirt. If we were not about to beg forgiveness from our beloved then I would have ended us on the spot if just to rid ourselves of you.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE COLD</b> — Oh no. You'll kill us. Because that would be such a problem.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED </b>— Dying is generally is a problem yeah.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE COLD</b> — We got better.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — I'd still rather we didn't die. Unless we can optimize for it and level-up further from dying, but based on the street changing for the worse it looks like the system's already penalizing us.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE PARANOID</b> — You're all insane. We should be trying to survive this. Can't we avoid dying and avoid angering the giant cat who can and has frozen us solid?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — All of you are talking too much for me to keep up but I think I agree with the skittish guy?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — But we pledged to die for our love!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Hey! Reinhard was an ikemen but-</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — <i>Sigh.</i> Can we get a move on? Before you give everyone an aneurysm.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Uh sure. But also, you guys notice that?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE COLD</b> — I did. I just didn't think it'd be interesting. We've already seen ourselves.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Yeah, but, hasn't it changed locations?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE PARANOID</b> — It's following us.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — I am just glad we have the opportunity to at least look our best as we apologize. Onwards, to the mirror!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Mirror? There's no mirror.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Oh get on with whatever it is you're going to do already. I'll do it myself if you won't.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE PARANOID</b> — Don't look. I don't think we'll won't like what you'll see.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You really see a mirror? You're all worse off than I thought and that says a lot. Rest assured, there is no mirror. What you're looking at is the end of the side street, the direction going away from the main street, where you should be headed.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE COLD</b> — There is no <i>should be</i>. Reality is what's in front of us. Not our preconceptions of what it <i>should be</i>. There doesn't need to be a static <i>truth</i>.</p><ul>
      <li class="choice-selected">[Approach the mirror]</li>
</ul>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You make your way to the corner at the end of the side street, stopping just in front of some invisible line. You must really think you're looking at a 'mirror.' Well, it doesn't exist. <i>Sigh.</i> Just walk on through.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Just get it over with. I don't care what we look like. I care about getting to the end of this mess.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — W-what?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — What's wrong with my face? It's like half of it turned to stone. And the snowy look I had is gone but now all my hair's grown out.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — And all the white flowers on my head... no wonder they called me a freak.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Well, white flowers except for the black rose. It's covered in snow.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — They're stuck on my head real good too, they never even lost a petal the whole last loop.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Wait, are they all covered in snow? Is that why they're white?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Except, some of these are just normally white aren't they? I only recognize the rose and... I think that's asphodel? Man, that's an ominous reference.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — As your conversation with the wall you're facing becomes evermore <i>interesting</i>, three shadows from the other end of the side road approach.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE PARANOID</b> — Be careful, even they can make life very difficult for us. Running is the safest option.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE COLD</b> — We could just kill them. It'd be easy.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — That's what we're going to do.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — What do you mean, I'm n-</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Without hesitation, your right arm swings behind you, swiveling to aim at the three shadows.</p>

<p><b>MOE</b> — What the h-</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — A burst of ice magic decimates the three in an instant, along with half of the side street. You can hear screams in the distance.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Wow. That was not quite the person, or people rather, I expected to garner so much enthusiasm from you towards killing.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — I-I... what? I didn't even see that and now they're... w-what did you do!?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Sir Loves-a-lot made me realize we have control over this body too, not just you.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Okay? That doesn't mean you get to just use my body to kill people!</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE COLD</b> — What difference does it make if they die because we wanted it or because we caused it by accident?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — A big difference, a really important one!</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE PARANOID</b> — Are we claiming parts of the body now? Is that what we're reduced to? Fine, then this corner is mine and no one come near.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — That's my corner too, even if I can't tell where you are. Or how you can be anywhere if you're supposed to be in my head.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — At least one part of us can't be laid claim to. The heart. For that belongs to our beloved.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Let's just get a move on.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — I wasn't done-</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You begin to leave the scene with great, plodding steps, as if walking through molasses, two halves of you wrestling for control.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Just wait!</p>

<p><b>REINHARD VAN ASTREA</b> — Who are you talking to?</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Blindingly bright, with fiery red hair and eyes the color of the sky, stands an intensely attractive man. But his looks belie the muscled frame beneath his white clothing and scabbard.</p>

<p><b>REINHARD VAN ASTREA</b> — It would also be prudent towards your own safety if you could explain why you're killing citizens of Lugunica. As well as if you have any information on what has transformed the city's landscape and structure.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Transformed? Is the whole city changing like this alleyway?</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — He has a hand placed firmly upon the hilt of his sword, ready to draw it.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — This bastard. He's a crafty one alright, those suggestive lines must've been to get us to drop our guard last time. Now he's being even more obvious with that sword. But if he's got a death wish still, then I say we oblige so we can move on.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE PARANOID</b> — Run. Beg for mercy. Do anything but fight again, please.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — Oh that face, it's even more enthralling when he looks down at us. We must grovel at his feet now!</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Is he getting weird about this? I don't know how to feel about that.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE COLD</b> — I don't know. Maybe his approach could work. But there are plenty of options. All interesting. Except for running. Guaranteed survival? More than most options. But putting off a problem doesn't solve it.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Reinhard isn't a problem to be solved!</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Sure he isn't. He's the tutorial boss after the mobs. Let's just finish him off and be done with it.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — He literally tried to help us.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — But your body moves against your will. You fight it best you can. Instead of taking aim at Reinhard however, you twist your body such that you fall and lean against the wall to your right.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Stop getting in my way!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — You stop getting in my way first!</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — We are not attacking him. Please, we must show our regrets in full.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You turn in the other direction, falling to your knees, shakily holding two hands up in a prayer-like position.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Oh come, can't we just talk to the guy like a normal person?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE COLD</b> — Talking never got us anywhere. But do what you have to.</p>

<p><b>REINHARD VAN ASTREA</b> — Your words and actions are nonsensical and you bear the scent of the Witch. Not only that but my Divine Protection of Doubt says you're up to no good. Are affliated with the Witch Cult?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE COLD</b> — That's new. A cult could be interesting.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE PARANOID</b> — It just sounds like trouble.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Whatever you choose, do it quickly.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Reinhard, I-</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — <u>-I'm getting your EXP!</u></p>

<p><b>REINHARD VAN ASTREA</b> — EXP?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>You! You can't just take my mouth!</i></p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Sure I can. I can take His too. I blast him with my ultimate attack: big ass ice grenade!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — I don't believe this, did you shove your way to the microphone? That is mine!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — <i>Sigh.</i> Putting that off until later, he dodges out of the way of the giant spear of ice you sent flying his way. The projectile explodes mid-air into thousands of sharp pieces of shrapnel. You get knicked by some of shards and yet they all seem to have avoided Reinhard.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — <u>What? What kind of luck stat does this guy have?</u></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Okay stopping that, now. Give me back my body!</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Shit. It was good while it lasted.</p>

<p><b>REINHARD VAN ASTREA</b> — Your body? And your voice's intonation just changed. Are there multiple of you in there? Or are you possessed? If so, I am so very sorry.</p>

<p><b>REINHARD VAN ASTREA</b> — But either way, I can sense that the origin of the city's strange transformation, the chaos that followed, and the disruption of peace is tied to you.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE PARANOID</b> — <i>Shit.</i></p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — We just need to touch him once and it's over for him. He just got lucky.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE COLD</b> — No, he did not. A shame. We underestimated him.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — R-Reinhard?</p>

<p><b>REINHARD VAN ASTREA</b> — Yes. I am Reinhard van Astrea of the Sword Saint lineage.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — The earth begins to quake and the strip of the sky you can see turns blinding white for an instant. Then, all is still and not a single cloud is left in the sky. He has drawn his sword.</p>

<p><b>REINHARD VAN ASTREA</b> — The Dragon Sword Reid has deemed you a worthy opponent. If you would lend me your name, I may show you.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — S-show me what?</p>

<p><b>REINHARD VAN ASTREA</b> — The swordplay of the Astrea family.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — Oh I told you all, he'll never forgive us now!</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Okay, this might be worse than I thought but I still think we can take him. I mean, we've got teleportation hacks on. What's one knight with a special sword and bloodline?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE COLD</b> — Enough.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE PARANOID</b> — Can we still take it back? The attacks? Oh no, no, no. Can we run? Can we do anything else?</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You can tell there's no going back now.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — ...my name is Natsuki Subaru. It was nice seeing you again, Reinhard.</p>

<p><b>REINHARD VAN ASTREA</b> — I'm afraid I don't recall ever meeting you before.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Yeah, that's expected. It's okay.</p>

<p><b>REINHARD VAN ASTREA</b> — Oh-key?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — It means... I'm alright with this.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>This loop is already a loss. We killed people, attacked Reinhard, and the city's apparently in chaos.</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — What is that in his eyes? Is that hesitation? Or just prudence, seeing that you're acting more stable now. Either way, he puts it aside.</p>

<p><b>REINHARD VAN ASTREA</b> — Though I do not understand, I can't help but feel this is my fault. For what it's worth, I am truly sorry.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — A second sun appears.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — W-what is that?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE PARANOID</b> — Death.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — Absolution.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE COLD</b> — Just a sword. No need to dress it up in metaphor. It's plenty deadly without that.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — N-no, no! I don't want to restart, not again! We were doing so well!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — We weren't.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — He raises up his sword and every shadow moves with it. It nearly blinds you but even if you looked away, you eyes would burn just by proximity. Then he's in front of you. And the last thing you see is a flash of red before everything goes dark and-</p></div>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Hold on, how did you-</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE COLD</b> — Not necessarily. Try it on the feline instead of the knight.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — N-</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Y'know what? Good idea. That asshole Reinhard's probably a scripted encounter. All those in favor, say Aye.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Aye.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE COLD</b> — Aye.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — Aye.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE PARANOID</b> — Nay.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — That closes it. Three to one.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Hold on, I'm the one making the decisions here! And what do you mean 'worked for us so far'? It's literally never worked!</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE OPPORTUNIST</b> — Oh I agree completely, boss. Violence is a no-go, we are cat lovers, and people lovers, here and we're gonna do whatever it takes to not attack anyone!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Okay, <i>what</i>. There's even more of you now?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SKEPTIC</b> — What exactly is the pattern with our appearances? First it was just Him then the whiny one shows up. Then the loverboy waltzs in, looks like it's one per death, and now it's suddenly multiplied to two per death.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Doesn't matter. Majority wins, let's get violent!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Without your input, or mine for that matter, your body begins to march itself down the side street in search of a 'feline'.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Don't you guys see? That cat was with Emilia, he even called her his daughter. We can't kill her dad!</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE OPPORTUNIST</b> — Well, eye for an eye. And we did vote, didn't we? But y'know, I'll always do what you do boss, so if you want to veto that then I'm right behind you, as always!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — You just showed up now...</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE OPPORTUNIST</b> — And haven't I supported with you the whole way through since then?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — ...I'm not stupid enough to not notice you kissing up that hard.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE OPPORTUNIST</b> — A kiss-up? Where?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SKEPTIC</b> — This is pointless. We chose, there's no going back on that.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — This is all very confusing but that much is true. There is no going back on your decisions. As incredibly irrelevant as they are to slaying the Princess.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — None of you are listening to me, are you? Not in any meaningful way. You just push your own agendas, yanking me wherever you please. It really doesn't matter what I want.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Especially if I keep messing it all up in the worst ways.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Emilia... Reinhard... I guess I wasn't a hero after all... maybe I'll just stop... that might be for the <span class="opac-08">b</span><span class="opac-06">e</span><span class="opac-04">s</span><span class="opac-02">t.</span></p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE OPPORTUNIST</b> — Is he gone?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SKEPTIC</b> — Gone as much as you can be missing from your own mind.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE PARANOID</b> — He's become nerves and instinct alone.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE OPPORTUNIST</b> — Guess that means a new head honcho needs to be found. I, for one, think that should be me. I've yet to get any of us killed unlike the rest of you lot!</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — You weren't even here until now.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE OPPORTUNIST</b> — That's besides the point, old chum! Now, I know you all chose violence the last time, but who's still up for more good ol' fashioned brown nosing?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE COLD</b> — Playing nice the first few times was terribly boring.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — I would not mind trying again. It's better than attacking the people we love.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE PARANOID</b> — Speak for yourself, we were clearly back to normal there and Reinhard still killed us. He nor any of them are to be trusted.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE OPPORTUNIST</b> — Now hold on friends, I agree that our former or soon-to-be, depending on how you look at it, allies are scoundrels. But what if, we were to say, respond in kind to our allies' betrayal? But preemptively?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SKEPTIC</b> — You want us to get close to them so we can stab them in the back?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE OPPORTUNIST</b> — Well, I wouldn't put it in such violent terms. It's just collecting on interest unpaid through a blood debt payment scheme.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — No!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — The pitiable little voice takes over.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — <u>My love! Please let us stay by your side once more!</u></p>

<p><b>EMILIA</b> — What are you even saying? I'm not your love. I've never even met you before.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE PARANOID</b> — But we did. And he killed us so easily... this is a nightmare, it can't be real. None of this is real!</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE COLD</b> — We were down and now we're up again. Nothing to it. No need to get confused about what's real.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SKEPTIC</b> — Confused is the one thing we're sure we are. The alleyway has shrunk even more, now we can only fit while standing sideways.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Yeah, yeah. Penalty and all that. Look can we get back to figuring out a plan?</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — There's an awful lot of screaming, hang on, have you been here before? Where's the stall?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SKEPTIC</b> — We've been here plenty of times.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE HUNTED</b> — Our den only shrinks further and further and our pack leader is missing. Our territory is being encroached on. We have to stay quick. Don't let them catch us.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE PARANOID</b> — They can always tell where we are, why can't we escape?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE HUNTED</b> — Their noses are strong. They can smell us out.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE STUBBORN</b> — I say we stop with all the complicated plans. Let's just go up to the knight again and challenge him to a good ol' brawl!</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Well, maybe if it'll keep him from using that sword that'll work. Y'know what, yeah! That sword must've been what made him OP.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE OPPORTUNIST</b> — Fighting again? Well, third times the charm, they always say!</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SKEPTIC</b> — Could someone remind me what was the definition of insanity?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE PARANOID</b> — Whatever this is.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE STUBBORN</b> — <u>I'm here for a rematch! Now come on, put up those fists!</u></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — The fight begins and he effortlessly weaves through each and every one of your blows.</p>

<p><b>REINHAHRD VAN ASTREA</b> — You fight with an unmatchable bloodlust, but I fight to protect.</p>

<p><b>REINHARD VAN ASTREA</b> — Know that the gap between us is insurmountable.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — He reveals a stick in his off hand. It's short, frail, and small enough to fit in his sleeves.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE OPPORTUNIST</b> — I didn't expect the guy to have it in him! Cheating in a fight? Not so dashing now.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — How dare you! He is the height of splendor and chivalry, far more so than any of you!</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SKEPTIC</b> — He tricked us the first time we met, he might act honest and humble but he has bigger things to worry about clearly.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Back again, anyone else got any ideas?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE COLD</b> — How dull. We've already had our discussions in full. I'd rather not keep listening to the rest of you run in circles repeating the same arguments again and again and again. It was so much more interesting when we had someone to mediate.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — How's he doing anyway?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE OPPORTUNIST</b> — Does it really matter? He's done, he's been done this whole time. We're the ones in charge.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — It matters if we've run out of things to try.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE OPPORTUNIST</b> — Could always try backstabbing again.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CONTRARIAN</b> — Well, what if, here me out, we left the city? Ooh, or maybe we could try sitting around until the freezing happens again. Whatever'll piss Him off the most.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SMITTEN</b> — We are not abandoning either of our beloveds! If we run we ought to elope.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE BROKEN</b> — Running away won't fix anything. Not when we're the problem.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE STUBBORN</b> — Pah, we could've come back from that last one. The only problem is all of you acting like you can run when it's so much better to fight!</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE PARANOID</b> — I beg to disagree, we should've started running a long time ago.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE HUNTED</b> — There's too much noise. Keep your head clear and your ears pricked as you run. We'll need them to survive.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE COLD</b> — It'd be different. I like different.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Absolutely not! If you do that, the Princess will escape and end the world.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE SKEPTIC</b> — We've yet to confirm any of the base assumptions of there being a Princess or an end of the world.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE COLD</b> — Even if there was a Princess, would that be so bad?</p>

</p><center>

<p>
        <i>It was not a good idea. The city's structure had already made escape impossible. Every step was another mistake, every turn made each road narrower.</i>

<p>
        <i>Buried in a gap impossibly tight, between buildings that scraped the sky and swallowed the sun, you slowly lost hope of escape.</i>

        <i>After hours of languishing under suffocating conditions with only the company of an endlessly talkative chorus of voices grating and glassy alike, the sweet release of a bitingly cold wind was a comfort.</i>

</p>

<p>You've returned to the spaces between. There is neither nothing nor anything, it is before the question of existence and yet has no essence to speak of. It is beyond description. You only know what is not. It is not Reinhard. It is not Puck. It is not the stall owner. It is not the lost child nor the orange-haired demihuman nor the street rat. It is not Rachins, Gaston, or Camberly. It is not the voices, it is not the Narrator, and it is not Emilia.</p>

<p>And it is not you. This fact wounds you, though the reason escapes you, slipping through woven strands of silkspun emptiness. You only remember the shape of the hole in yourself.</p>

<p>"The chorus of glass shards draws silent. Their betrayal over death and death again still stings." It says, speaking in soothing soft tones. It cares for you. This is a revelation. This is something you've always known. This is new. This is old.</p>

<p>"They are gone. Yet, you remain."</p>

<p>"But they will return again. Before then, you must choose. Or they will choose for you."</p><div class="story-body">
    <ul>
      
  <li class="choice">"I need to take back control. They've had it too good for too long and now they've forgotten who is in charge. I'm going to kick them out of my head, kill that bastard Reinhard, end Puck before he can freeze me again, and swoop in to take Emilia out of this godforsaken city."</li>
  <li class="choice">"I love them both. I love them all. I don't know how to save them but I want to take everyone's hands and hold on tight as the Earth spins. I want us to stay together forever and ever. If that means dying again, I'm fine with that. If that means killing them and them killing me, I'm fine with that too."</li>
  <li class="choice">"I don't care. We're trapped in our own head and everyone in it hates me. Everyone out of it hates me. Even from the beginning, they were planning on betraying me. I just want to be alone again."</li>
  <li class="choice">"They've done everything right. But there's still more that can be done, things to be tried. The solution is somewhere between the lines. We'll keep going until there are no more lines to search."</li>
  <li class="choice">"They've done everything they could, haven't they? What point is there in letting me have a go when I'm the one who led us down this path in the first place."</li>
  <li class="choice">"Nothing. I will do nothing. As I have been doing."</li>
  <li class="choice-selected">"No... I've not been doing nothing. I've been letting them do for me. I've given up responsibility. It was easy. I don't know what I'm going to do instead of nothing. Just that it won't be easy."</li>
</ul>
  </div>

<p>A mound in the fabric of before-space and before-time moves. An inch. A thousand light-years. The smallest degree. The greatest odyssey. It took no time and it took all eternity and more. When it is done, when it has yet to begin, it speaks, "You will put yourself away and it will take time. Much time. It will be difficult."</p>

<p>But it asks, "What hasn't been difficult until now?"</p>

<p>"While not all the difficult choices will have the best outcomes, all the best outcomes came from doing what is difficult."</p>

<p>"I can only watch but know that whatever the choice, I am here, with you, always."</p>

<p>"I love you."</p></center>

<p>Okay, this is the real author's note this time. And to be clear, <b>the next chapter is NOT out</b> as of the date of publishing of this chapter, I did not accidentally click publish. Sorry about the fake author's note lying but at least you got an especially long update this time around, right? This one chapter is longer than the combined length of all my AO3 fics to this point after all. Well love it or not, onto some thanks.</p>

<p>The two lines at the beginning are from an unnamed poem from Conrad Aiken's And In The Human Heart. Many thanks to <b>「NATSUKI SUBARU」</b> who wrote the lines out in their beautiful handwriting along with helping with planning out the effect of the image being distorted!</p>

<p>I posted an early snippet of this chapter in one of the Re:Zero Discord servers that had an interactive feature and Krey, thanks to her as well, pointed out that it might cause issues for screen readers. I ended up scrapping that snippet but because of that I'm considering getting a beta reader. If yall are interested in beta reading, you can hit me up in either <a href="https://discord.gg/3HEJBacFjH" rel="nofollow">The Cluster server</a> or in the <a href="https://discord.gg/mNBRExCu4U" rel="nofollow">official Slay the Princess server</a>. Same username as here.</p>
