<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — ...Why-</p><center>

<p>
      <i>A plainsong hymn rings out. A ticking clock plays accompaniment on a twelve-note scale. The lone vocalist's cooing echoes in low tones that shift, bouncing off of the nothingness that fills the sky and earth alike. It takes deep, desperate breaths between beats. Discordant and disconcerting it surrounds the boy, filling his every orifice. He sits in this melody between the beats of his heart. He sits in it forever and for not even an instant. Then it swallows his senses before spitting him out onto hard cobblestone.</i>
    </p></center>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — ...me?</p><center>

<p>
      <i>The warm sun beams down on him once again but he can feel a chill that cuts straight to his diaphragm. He nearly chokes on the smell of rancid bile on his breath but as he feels an urge to vomit, all that comes out is pillowy cold. He bites down. It's like ice cream.</i>
    </p></center>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You look blankly ahead, your eyes unfocused, and your skin clammy. All of a sudden, you fall to your knees.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — ...what?</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You collapse onto the ground, hunched over the cobblestone, shivering like a wet dog in a winter breeze. Your breaths are shallow but rapid.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Are you quite alright?</p>

<p><b>FRUIT SELLER</b> — Hey! Kid, what's going on?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — ...I-</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Bullshit! Fucking bullshit!</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Hardly a physical challenge for you, he said.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — I know enough and I've told you enough, he said.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — What are you two talking about?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — We're talking about how YOUR faulty info led to us dying like a dog in the middle of the street!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — ...dying?</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — The shaking intensifies. If you don't get a hold of yourself soon, you'll pass out.</p><ul>
<li class="choice">(Explore) I'm talking! I have a tongue! I'm alive! I'm not dead! I'm not frozen! I can hear myself!</li>
<li class="choice">(Explore) Oh fuck we died. Fuck, oh. I can't do this. I'm no hero. I can't. I can't. I can't.</li>
<li class="choice-selected">[Calm down.]</li>
<li class="choice">[Lose consciousness.]</li>
</ul>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You grab your chest and your heaving breaths forcibly start to slow. Even so, your heart only seems to speed up in response, thudding like a jackhammer against your ribcage.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Your sweat drips down your face and... shatters on the sidewalk like ice. Hm, that's new.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>I-it's cold still! Cold, cold, cold-!</i></p>

<p><b>FRUIT SELLER</b> — Hey! Oh damn it.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — The stall's owner exits his stall and walks over to you, hand outstretched.</p>

<p><b>FRUIT SELLER</b> — Come on, let's get you somewhere other than my stall so you can rest.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — His hand wanders over to your shoulder but he cringes and draws his hand back the moment he touches it, as if burnt by something, and mumbles to himself.</p>

<p><b>FRUIT SELLER</b> — Ow, a mage? His hair's even changed.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>I-I'm gonna die again, I'm gonna die! I can't do this, I just can't!</i></p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Oh, you've got to be-!</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Screw it, let me help.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — If we're gonna lose our minds it might as well be later rather than sooner. I'm gonna calm you down myself.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — H-how?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — I'm gonna get rid of all the shit that's in your head right now. Don't focus on the temperature, don't think about the little things you're worrying about.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Focus on the bullcrap. On being tricked. Don't get scared, get angry! We're getting through this stupid scenario and then we're getting out of here.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — No one, not the Princess nor He, are going to be able to stop us. I'll burn this city to ash before I let us get tricked into dying again.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — ...</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Your shivers start to subside and your heart slows. You're not as well as you were earlier but the worst of it has passed.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — You better be fine now.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — ...<i>pfft. Tsundere.</i></p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — You-!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Thanks for that pep talk. And yeah, I feel better.</i></p>

<p><b>FRUIT SELLER</b> — H-hey, I don't care if you're a mage or what but pick another stall to have, whatever that was, in front of next time!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Mage?</p>

<p><b>FRUIT SELLER</b> — If you're not buying anything then leave!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Fine, fine. Sorry for bothering you!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You stand slowly and uneasily but do get to your feet. Taking the plastic bag of groceries next to you, you leave the vicinity of the fruit stand and continue down your path.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Okay, let's sort this out while I walk.</i></p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Not much to sort. We got fucked over, we died, and now we're back here with everything back to normal.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Died? Back to normal? I can assure you that you haven't died. And even if you did, as provably untrue that is, people don't just die and come back to life.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Well it seems we're the exception then! We die and go back to a checkpoint, we load a save.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Load a save? This isn't some video game for your entertainment, the fate of the world hangs in the balance. Everyone is counting on you and treating this like it's just some toybox for you to muck about in isn't helpful in the least.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Need I remind you of the stakes once more?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Oh come on you two, let me just sort out my own thoughts before you start with the "end of everything" again.</i></p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED </b> — End of everything but us, from the looks of it.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Right, that blizzard...</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — An instinctual shiver runs down your spine.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>If we really went back in time then that blizzard is going to hit again!</i></p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED </b> — Seeing it again would certainly be one way to prove we died. Not that we need to prove anything since He already knows that we died, even if he's playing dumb.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — I'm not playing anything. I don't lie, not to you.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>I'm putting that line in our "Quote Me" box.</i></p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED </b> — Done. That'll be fun to shove in his face later.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Whoever you are new voice, you've got the right idea about things!</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Oh god no.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED </b> — You're not bad yourself. And anyone who's an enemy of Him and the Princess is an ally. Though we're stuck together no matter what aren't we?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Seems like it. I'm taking the top bunk!</i></p><ul>

</ul>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You rub your chin as you walk, swinging your grocery bag as you do.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>How can I prove I went back in time and didn't just... respawn a few days later in front of the fruit stall? Maybe the blizzard ended, maybe they cleaned up, and it just looked like how it was before?</i></p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED </b> — That sounds like the kind of bullshit He'd spin. That is if he wasn't insisting we haven't died at all.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — It's not wrong to insist on things that are just true.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED </b> — Just like before, you're pulling shit out of your ass.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Like before... before... the past... time passing... wait, wait!</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You begin rubbing your chin more aggressively, wiping the palm of your hand off of it. What are you trying to achieve?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED </b> — Wait a minute, he's got an idea.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>An idea? No, I just can't believe I forgot my special skill!</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>I can judge how much time has passed roughly from the length of my stubble. And right now, my skin is as smooth as a baby's bottom!</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — What?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Which means...</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>My body returned to a previous state!</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Which means...</i></p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED </b> — We travel through time when we die. Between it being daytime again, there being a lot less dead people than before, and you still having your tongue, it's the only explanation that makes sense.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED </b> — You have a special ability after all. Load of crud that does for us if dying is the expectation though.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>That or we just saw a vision of the future.</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>A very, very vivid vision of the future...</i></p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED </b> — Either way, we're set up to fail again unless we find a way through this bullshit.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Hold on now. Traveling through time? Visions of the future? Measuring the length of your stubble? Can you hear yourself right now?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED </b> — We can hear ourselves just fine. It's you who we refuse to listen to. Your instructions got us killed last time!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Like I've been saying, there is no last time. And even if there were a last time, the only reason you would presumably die is if you didn't follow my instructions correctly.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Shut it, bastard. We're wise to your tricks now.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>What he said! But, uh, we should probably work together still to figure this out.</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Antagonizing me just to say we should work together anyways? You truly are a creature of contradictions, aren't you?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>It's not a contradiction to call you out but also want to work with you!</i></p><ul>
<li class="choice-selected">(Explore) Can we discuss the Princess?</li>
<li class="choice">(Explore) Who are you exactly Mr. Narrator?</li>
<li class="choice">(Explore) Can we look into the new voice thing a bit more actually?</li>

</ul>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>So I have questions about the Princess.</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Just be quick about it.</p><ul>
<li class="choice-selected"> (Explore) Last time, I died because of a sudden blizzard. Was that her? How am I supposed to slay her then?</li>
<li class="choice"> (Explore) She's in a cabin, right? Why? Who put her there? And if they did, why is she still alive?</li>
<li class="choice">Nevermind.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>I have questions about the Princess. Last time, I died because of a sudden blizzard. That was her, right?</i></p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Doesn't matter if it's the same person He's been talking about this time or not. Whoever they are, we're in their crosshairs.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Well, I doubt it unless they also know about us somehow. But even if they don't, we still need to slay whoever they are right? Or at least stop them from doing that again. The question is: how?</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You'll need a weapon. In the cabin, there will be a pristine blade waiting for you.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Is there even a fucking cabin? Let alone a blade?</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Of course there is, what would I have to gain from misleading you when my and everyone's imminent survival depends on your success?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>That blade better be really, really OP if we're going up against someone who can summon blizzards!</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — At least you two understand how dangerous she is but let me assure you that she'll be no match for your...</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — ...</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — ...grit and tenacity?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Hold on, what was with that pause! It's not THAT hard to come up with a compliment for me!</i></p><ul>
<li class="choice-selected"> (Explore) She's in a cabin, right? Why? Who put her there? And if they did, why is she still alive?</li>
<li class="choice">Nevermind.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>She's in a cabin, right? In the middle of a city? Why? Why is there a cabin? Why put her in a cabin specifically? Who put her there? And if someone captured her already then why not just...</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — As you walk, you hold up a finger on free hand and draw it across your neck slowly as if slicing it with a blade.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You do so while coincidentally, a small demihuman with cat ears is staring at you.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Cat ears? Where?</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You slow to a stop and scan your surroundings with excitement, your eyes landing on the demihuman. They appear to wear a white robe and have orange hair. Their eyes widen as you lock eyes.</p>

<p><b>YOUNG DEMIHUMAN</b> — Eep!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — It appears your murderous gesture and overall countenance hasn't done you any favors.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — No, no. I was just thinking about something! Don't be scared!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>And by the way, who the heck still says "countenance" in this day and age?</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — I do? It's a good word, I don't see why I should stop using it just because time has passed.</p>

<p><b>YOUNG DEMIHUMAN</b> — Alright... oh, say have you seen a girl who looks like me? Same height, same robes, similar hair?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>And same ears, I hope! God, he's adorable. I just want to scratch him behind the ears!</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Sorry, I think I'd remember seeing someone as adorable as that!</p>

<p><b>YOUNG DEMIHUMAN</b> — Pfft. That she is. But haven't seen her, huh? She can't be down that way then...</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — The young animal hybrid ruminates.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Not that it matters much, but can we go back to asking questions without getting answers instead of answering questions without knowing the answers? There's no point in talking to this kid.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>But that's where you're wrong! Helping someone this cute means we might be able to pet them!</i></p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Knowing our luck, that'll just lead to getting bitten.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Not true, actually. My affinity with animals is off the charts!</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Are the two of you done? Because the demihuman left while the two of you were arguing.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Ack, he's right!</i></p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Now going back...?</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Yes. Going back to your questions from earlier, you asked quite a lot of them but my answer to all would be the same: I can't tell you.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Surprise, surprise.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — I've already told you all that you need to know. Going into more detail would just overcomplicate what should be simple and make your life all the more difficult.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — The less you know about her, the better this will turn out for everyone.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Everyone but us.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — I know it sounds like I'm hiding something but this really is for the best. You'll have to trust me on that.</p><ul>
<li class="choice-selected">Nevermind.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>We really didn't learn much from that.</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>I need to start forming a plan as we go which means I shouldn't waste too much time on these if the answers are all the same.</i></p><ul>
<li class="choice">(Explore) Who are you exactly Mr. Narrator?</li>
<li class="choice">(Explore) Can we look into the new voice thing a bit more actually?</li>
<li class="choice">(Explore) That appa guy called me a mage earlier...</li>
<li class="choice-selected">(Explore) Let's assume I'm telling the truth. If I did die and go back in time then nothing I did back then matters. Why should I bother doing what you say? Why bother doing anything?</li>
<li class="choice">(Explore) I need more information about what's happening. Where are we? What is this place?</li>
<li class="choice">I'm definitely in over my head here. I'm going to look for the guards or knights or whatever the equivalent for police is.</li>
<li class="choice">I don't even know the name of this city yet, I'm gonna go exploring and find out!</li>
<li class="choice">[Turn around and leave.]</li>
<li class="choice">[Continue down the path silently.]</li>
</ul>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>So, let's assume I'm telling the truth. I died and I returned from death back to that appa stand. That means nothing I did after that point matters, it never happened. Why should I bother doing what you say then, if I'll just end up back there? Why should I do anything?</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Those are two very different questions, but fine. I'll indulge you if that's what it takes to get you moving again.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Let's say for a moment that this really is the second time you've met me, or, at least a version of me.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You died last time, which probably only happened because you didn't listen to me.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>You really don't remember what happened last time, do you?</i></p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — We literally only died because we did as you said. You led us down the wrong path and then just narrated our death as we froze uselessly.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — I wouldn't have led you down the wrong path because I'd have no reason to lie about that. All that would do is cause harm to you, and in turn, cause harm to me and everyone who like to be alive.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>You didn't lie. Not really. You admitted to being wrong about where the Princess is.</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Now that doesn't sound the sort of thing I'd say at all, which is all the more reason for you not to buy into whatever self-delusions the two of you are crafting.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — <i>Sigh.</i> But this is a thought experiment, so I suppose I'll continue to give you the benefit of the doubt. If you did follow my instructions but ended up dying, then did you follow them correctly? Or did you waste time like you did with the fruit stall and the demihuman? Did you decide to take a nap or go sunbathing? Because if all that really happened then the only person you can blame is yourself.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — And if this theoretical version of me admitted to being inadequate, then He can only be as inadequate as the person he was trying to guide.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>...</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Anyways, I believe your second question was "what's the point of doing anything?" If you're asking that, it sounds to me like you're making the rather dangerous assumption that your actions last time around didn't have any consequences.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Obviously.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Yes, but, in this purely hypothetical scenario, that begs the question of <i>how</i> you got back here. Did 'time' simply rewind itself, or were you instead transported to a different world entirely?</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — If the latter, then what do you think happened <i>after</i> you died?</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Do you think the people there lived happily ever after, or do you think that the Princess, left unhindered, brought about the end to everyone and everything, just like I told you she would?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>...no. No! They're all... dead?</i></p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Screw that. Who cares what happened to everyone else? She's planning to kill us again so we should just save ourselves and get out of here.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>That's... that's... kind of a psycho way of thinking, actually. But... if the threat is so great that I can't hope to overcome it...</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — No, no. That is <i>absolutely</i> a psychotic way of thinking, not to mention moronic. You do realize that "everything and everyone" includes you right? If you turn around and leave, you're dooming yourself as well as everyone else.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>...he's right. I have to do something.</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>I'm the hero, right? As far as He says, at least. And I've got an Isekai power to match...</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Assuming the past day wasn't just a vision of my death. It could be, I can't discount that entirely, but... dying like that felt so real... so painful. If it was real then that means...</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i> I take a leap in time each time I die. The fact that it's the kind of power that assumes you're going to lose— feels like my power is custom-made for a loser like me.</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>I can't be completely sure if the voices in my head are part of it but since I got a new voice after dying, I can at least assume they're related.</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You continue down your path. Though your pace isn't quick, the time spent in thought was long enough that you come across a side street.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Oh it's this alley again... maybe? Something seems... different. I can't place it.</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>The light is falling on the crates in the same way. Wait, there's also a mirror now? Is that what changed? How that'd even get here?</i></p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — We're back to the real way forward.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>You didn't mention the mirror at the bend in the alley?</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Mirror? There isn't any mirror, not that you can see from here.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — The mirror's right fucking there? What is he going on about now?</p><ul>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You walk up to the wall of the alleyway. It's a wall. There isn't much to see here.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — This thing's filthy! Can't see anything reflected in it.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You reach forward and rub your hand against the wall. Disregarding the tone of awe in your voice, at least you recognize how weird you look. Though ridiculous and delusional would be my choice of words.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — And now the mirror's gone. Yet another thing playing tricks on us.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — What? No, it's right here.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — The two of you can't even get your stories to match. I would suggest hurrying up now that you've wasted your time here.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Stories? I'm just telling it how I see it and what I'm seeing is my own reflection!</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Oh don't tell me even you're lying now.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — I don't think I even could lie to... you know, I don't think I've addressed the fact that there's another extra voice in my head now, but I don't think I could lie to you anyways since you're in my head.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — So is <i>He</i>. And we know he's a liar, alright.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — But I'll admit, <i>He's</i> definitely different from me, separate compared to you.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — I look so different. My hair looks like a Christmas tree that got left on the porch too long and the snow built up on it.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — There's also some kind of blizzard happening in the mirror? What could that mean? The whole side street looks ruined from inside the mirror.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — As your conversation with the wall you're facing becomes evermore <i>interesting</i>, three shadows from the other end of the side road approach.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Is that-</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — -a random encounter. Our luck's screwed up isn't it? A new hand, a new table, but the same dealer and the same shitty house rules. <i>Wonderful.</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — I was going to say "cute girl who summoned me". Maybe, it's not too late for your expectations to be subverted?</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You look away from the wall to see three thugs of varying heights but similarly untoward appearances.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Damn, you were right. Well, it's less a random encounter and more a compulsory event, probably the part of the tutorial where we learn to fight.</p>

<p><b>DIMINUTIVE THUG</b> — What the hell is this guy babbling about?</p>

<p><b>LARGE THUG</b> — He doesn't get what's going on here.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — What on earth are you complaining about? These epithets couldn't be more accurate.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Accuracy is one thing but precision is another! You might as well call them extras numero <b>Uno</b>, <b>Dos</b>, <b>Tres</b>!</p>

<p><b>TRES</b> — What the hell is he talking about now?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Wait, that worked?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>It's a rule of the Isekai genre that any person transported to a new world gains some OP ability. You'd initially think that's Return by Death but that appa guy earlier called me a mage right? My appearance change must be because of my new powers finally coming to life!</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>While I couldn't do anything to a blizzard, there's nothing that can really harm me in the tutorial fight! If I just believe in myself, that power will awaken!</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — You lumps of EXP!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Take this! Haaaaaa-</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Haaaaaaa!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — As you shout, a burst of ice forms.</p>

<p><b>DUMB</b> — He's a mag-</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — And without you able to control it, it shoots out and expands larger and larger in a chaotic uncontrollable cascade. It quickly envelops the three thugs, only leaving them enough time to look on in horror, their expressions frozen forever. The entire alleyway is blocked by a massive shard of ice.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Look, look, we won!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — That much is clear, yes. I believe the technical term for<br />
this would be overkill.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — ...ice powers.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Uh, yes. You have ice powers, that much has been made clear.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Sounding a bit morose, aren't you?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — I just killed them. With ice powers.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — A difficult act but a noble one in light of preventing the end of everything.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — The blizzard.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Was that. Was that me?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Did I do that?</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Well given there was no blizzard to speak of, I can't see how you could be held accountable for it.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — ...accountable?</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — A sudden bout of reflux builds in your throat and you lean against a wall for support. You heave but all that leaves your esophagus is bunny white snow.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — T-this...! This isn't about, I just, I killed! I...</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You sniffle and water builds at the corners of your eyes. Are you... crying?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — What you didn't expect this? Please, they were gunning for us and they got what they deserved.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — There's no point getting upset. Especially since we've now got two abilities: time travel and ice magic. The deck is stacked in our favor.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — ...let's just go.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You walk away from the frozen thugs. The way back has been blocked by your ice so you continue your journey down this side street.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — This isn't the right way, so even if the street is blocked now I think you ought to find a way to return to the path.</p><ul>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — ...</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Fine, be that way. The busy markets and winding alleyways of the city's center give way and the constant hustle and bustle of the people turn to silence. The architecture degrades and it's clear you're closing in on the margins of the city.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — This is... in the same direction that blizzard came from right? It's hard to tell but we're probably not far.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Which means there might be a cabin. but probably not, He definitely just made that up to screw with us.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Now you're getting on the ground and <i>curling up into a ball</i>?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>I killed them.</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>And I might've killed everyone last time.</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>I... I can't do this. I can't be trusted to do anything. I can't even be trusted with myself.</i></p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Except us. Doesn't that suck? Knowing you've got nothing to wager with?</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — I've heard quite enough out of you. Look I understand you're feeling guilty right now but it's only going to be worse if you have this entire world on your conscience.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>...talk all you want. It's all gibberish to me now.</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You lie in the middle of the unpaved dirt street. Pitying glances from the similarly unfortunate are thrown your way. Afternoon gives way to dusk and the sun begins to dip below the horizon.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You're really going to do this? Abandon everyone and everything? For a second time no less if your words are to be believed.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>...</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Fine.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — It beams down on you until it's blocked by a woman who stands in front of your curled up body. Her voice is seductive and dark with a teasing lilt to it.</p>

<p><b>SULTRY WOMAN</b> — My. A uniquely pitiful person in an already pitiful place. Your scent brings up particularly distasteful memories.</p>

<p><b>SULTRY WOMAN</b> — I'm rather curious as to how but now isn't the time. Stay there, if you would be so kind.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — The woman sidesteps you and continues on her way.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — The sound of sparse foot traffic along with the gradual disappearance of the feeling of the sun against your cold skin are the only ways you can tell time is passing at all. The moon rises and night falls.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Once more, a woman walks over to you. Her voice is soft but lyrical, reminiscent of precious metals.</p>

<p><b>SILVER-VOICED WOMAN</b> — He looks cold.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — She's not talking to you but to herself. She doesn't know you're awake.</p>

<p><b>SILVER-VOICED WOMAN</b> — ...his hair ...maybe he has something to do with all that ice, and if that's the case... he might know about the thief.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — She inches closer to you, speaking in low tones.</p>

<p><b>SILVER-VOICED WOMAN</b> — If I heal you, you're going to have to tell me if you know the thief that stole from me. Or where the "loot house" is.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — The voice stirs something inside of you. Nothing carnal but it has an entrancing quality.</p><ul>
<li class="choice">I don't know anything.</li>
<li class="choice">Okay.</li>
<li class="choice-selected">[Remain silent.]</li>
</ul>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You don't grace her with a response. Regardless, she hovers her hands over your body and light and warmth emanates from them. You can feel the chill that's been everpresently with you recede, if just a bit.</p>

<p><b>SILVER-VOICED WOMAN</b> — There.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>...it's warm.</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>And her voice, it's so beautiful. It... it's so powerful, I feel tremors hearing it!</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — I'm sorry...</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — I'm so sorry...</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — The girl pauses, unsure of what it is you're apologizing for but she comes to her own conclusions eventually.</p>

<p><b>SILVER-VOICED WOMAN</b> — You're saying that you don't know anything?</p>

<p><b>SILVER-VOICED WOMAN</b> — It's alright, I've received compensation in finding out there isn't a connection between you and that thief. But it's more satisfying to hear a single "thank you" than a lot of "sorry"s.</p><ul>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>I can't just... do nothing. Even if I know I'm going to die at the end of this, I can't just leave her be without having done something, anything, to make up for all my debt to this world and the one I left behind by dying.</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>And most of all...</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — I can't let a beautiful, kind girl leave without helping her in return!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> —  You gather yourself to your feet and finally get a good look at her. She might better be described as a <b>Silver-Haired Woman</b> than describing using her voice. She's a beautiful girl around your age with long silver hair and intelligent purple eyes. Her features are soft and her clothing is high-quality, if not flashy. I'd say you might be dealing with a noble.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>A name change? Make it so!</i></p>

<p><b>SILVER-HAIRED WOMAN</b> — Beautiful?</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> —  She seems surprised by your off-the-cuff exclamation.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> —  Where did all this energy come from all of a sudden? You really got over yourself just because a pretty girl approached you with a question?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Of course! Now, you said you were looking for a thief?</p>

<p><b>SILVER-HAIRED WOMAN</b> — That's right. Did you see them?</p><ul>
<li class="choice-selected">Not at all!</li>
<li class="choice">(Lie) Yes I did.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Nope, I'm clueless. Oh, and I'm broke too.</p>

<p><b>SILVER-HAIRED WOMAN</b> — E-eh!?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — But if you're pursuing a thief, you're going to need a bodyguard right? I happen to be pretty darn good at ice magic!</p>

<p><b>SILVER-HAIRED WOMAN</b> — Ice... magic?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Well, magic that makes ice. That <i>is</i> the word for it here right? The apples to appas thing tripped me up.</p>

<p><b>SILVER-HAIRED WOMAN</b> — Wait, wait. I'm afraid I've already received adequate compensation from you. Don't think I'll heal you again if we meet again though, I did it because I wanted to find out what you knew and now that I do, our time here is over.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> —  She storms off after delivering a lengthy but insincere diatribe.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Hey, wait up!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> —  You follow her as she walks deeper into the slums with the light of the moon as your guide. The pitying glances follow you still, your appearance marred with dirt from having lied in it the entire day.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Hold on, please!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> —  She turns around at the sound of your plea.</p>

<p><b>SILVER-HAIRED WOMAN</b> — Why are you still following me?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — I... I might not know much but I want to help you. Even if you think you've been compensated, then... then I'm helping you for my own sake.</p>

<p><b>SILVER-HAIRED WOMAN</b> — For your own sake? I'm afraid I don't have any money to compensate you with.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Gah! Do I really look that much like a beggar?</p>

<p><b>SILVER-HAIRED WOMAN</b> — If you ask me what you look like, other than your strange clothes and odd appearance, I would have to say that the first impression I had of you was you lying in the middle of the dirt.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Oh, my heart-!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> —  You dramatically clutch your heart in mock pain while she looks on with an uneasy expression.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — To be dismissed so easily by a cute girl! It's every man's dream!</p>

<p><b>SILVER-HAIRED WOMAN</b> — You say some very strange things...</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — I'd say this whole situation's been strange but please let me help you, even if it's to help myself.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>If left to myself, I'm really going to drive myself crazy. At least with some company, especially with such a beautiful girl, then I might be able to pull myself together.</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>And it's the right thing to do, but I don't think she'd accept that kind of reasoning if she's so focused on justifying her compassion like she's embarrassed about it!</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — We're really going through with this diversion? There's no use doing a good deed if the world ends and we've wasted so much time by now.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — We are going to die anyway, no changing that at this point. It's already nighttime.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Oh be <b>quiet</b> you.</i></p>

<p><b>SILVER-HAIRED WOMAN</b> — ...alright.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Her unease melts away to a soft smile and the two of you are on your way.</p><ul>
<li class="choice-selected">So you're looking for a thief?</li>
<li class="choice">So, my name is Natsuki Subaru. What's yours?</li>
<li class="choice">[Watch her silently as you follow.]</li>
</ul>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — So you said something about a thief and a loot house?</p>

<p><b>SILVER-HAIRED WOMAN</b> — That's right. The thief stole something reeeeeeally important to me, an insignia with a jewel in it, and I was told she'd be at the "loot house". I don't know where that is exactly.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — I see. Then let me take the vanguard and ask around about this loot house.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You go up to one of the residents of these slums and almost immediately get an answer.</p>

<p><b>HELPFUL GUY</b> — Looking for Old Man Rom's loot house huh?</p>

<p><b>HELPFUL GUY</b> — It's up that way. Haha, that girl must've gotten something real important for that lady to come all the way out here.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — That girl?</p>

<p><b>HELPFUL GUY</b> — Felt. She's probably who you're looking for. Best of luck to the two of you in bargaining to try and get it back. Live strong!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — He leaves.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Nice, we got our lead! Looks like my charisma got a boost.</p>

<p><b>SILVER-HAIRED WOMAN</b> — I think it's just that the people here took pity on you. You really look like a mess.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Ack! My heart aches once more at the sight of a pretty girl insulting me!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — ...</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — ...I could do with a response.</p>

<p><b>SILVER-HAIRED WOMAN</b> — I'm just not sure what to say really.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — You don't have to say anything! I can read your expression like a book, it says: "I made the wrong decision letting a good for nothing like you follow me around! Don't make me laugh, even a dog would be better!"</p>

<p><b>SILVER-HAIRED WOMAN</b> — As if I'd say something so terrible. You've done a good job so far, little that you've done. I think you've thought this through and you don't seem like a liar.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Don't seem like a liar huh, not the highest of praise but I'll take it!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>...</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>This would be the part where Mr. The Narrator would say that we continued our walk with a new direction as the splendorifus girl and the unsplendorifus guy searched for the loot house. But...</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>You guys up there have been a little quiet haven't you?</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Don't tell me you've forgotten about little ol' me?</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — You were the one who told us to be quiet.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — And there's not much point in arguing at this point is there? You've made your decision and there's no taking that back now.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>You're not gonna tell me to turn around?</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — Like I said, you made your decision and as terrible as a decision it was, it can't be changed now. I suppose I'm just waiting to see this to its bitter, meaningless end now.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Don't sound so sad. If it really was my fault that a blizzard started in the last go-around then nothing should happen this time.</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>What about you, <b>Cheats?</b></i></p>

<p><b>CHEATS</b> — Don't call me that.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Sorry! You were saying?</i></p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Well, there's not much to talk about now. Still no princess in sight, even if I know she's gonna fuck us over soon.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>I really don't want to entertain this line of thinking but you guys don't think... huh, never asked her name. Well, doesn't this girl seem like a princess?</i></p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — She could be <i>a</i> princess but she can't be <i>the</i> Princess. If she were, then the world would have already ended once she left the cabin.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Hm.</p>

<p><b>SILVER-HAIRED WOMAN</b> — What is it?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Do you think a loot house is kind of cabin-y?</p>

<p><b>SILVER-VOICED WOMAN</b> — Cabin-y? Well, it can't really be a cabin if it's in a city right? Cabins are just homes in forests and mountains and other places like that.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — I guess that's right.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — It can't be a cabin, if it's in a city...?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Does that mean this whole fucking quest was impossible from the beginning!? Are you fucking kidding me!?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Oi, Narrator, did you look in a dictionary before all this and decide to send us packing for an impossible task? What's next, a married bachelor? A gatekeeper who tells the truth and a gatekeeper who tells only lies? A sphinx!?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Answer me!</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — ...</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATOR</b> — ...I'm getting a drink.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Is he-! Hey, I can hear you in the back there! Are you actually getting a drink?</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — ...is that the sound of a door being shut? Hold on, you can't just leave! Get back here!</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Fuck it, I'm chasing that bastard!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>...guys?</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>They're gone. They're really gone, huh. That's all it takes to quiet them, I guess.</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Oh hey, I think that's the loot house!</p>

<p><b>SILVER-HAIRED WOMAN</b> — You're right! It's larger than I expected. Just how many stolen goods do they sell here?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Too many I bet.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — So what's our plan of action?</p>

<p><b>SILVER-VOICED WOMAN</b> — I'll be upfront, go in, tell them they have the insignia they stole from me and ask them to return it.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — ...and if they refuse to? Are you going to bargain for it?</p>

<p><b>SILVER-HAIRED WOMAN</b> — I can't do that! Isn't it twisted to have to buy what belongs to you?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — I won't deny that but going in there without being able to compromise leads to...</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>...it leads to a repeat of that alleyway again.</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Let me negotiate for you. I've got a trump card up my sleeve.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Groceries from another world along with my phone: hopefully whatever was stolen from her isn't more precious than those.</i></p>

<p><b>SILVER-HAIRED WOMAN</b> — Alright, I'm counting on you.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — So you see, I h- wait, what?</p>

<p><b>SILVER-HAIRED WOMAN</b> — I trust you. You seem like a good boy despite your strangeness.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>She's really an angel isn't she? So quick to trust a good-for-nothing, someone who doesn't live up to their own name.</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Ah right, my name.</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Before we go in, please allow me to introduce myself since I forgot to until now.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — My name is Natsuki Subaru! First name Subaru, last name Natsuki. I'm a little less useless than before but still just as broke beyond compare! Besides my trump cards, of course!</p>

<p><b>SILVER-HAIRED WOMAN</b> — Pfft, ahahaha!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>She laughed! What a laugh, it sounds like bells ringing, it fills up my tummy with butterflies!</i></p>

<p><b>SILVER-HAIRED WOMAN</b> — You don't seem useless to me even if you seem a little clueless and I don't think you can call yourself broke if you really have something to bargain with...</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>...this would be the part where the Narrator would say: "But her voice trailed off like a beautiful swan giving pause in flight to glide gracefully through the air." But alas.</i></p>

<p><b>SILVER-HAIRED WOMAN</b> — My name...</p>

<p><b>EMILIA</b> — ...my name is <b>Emilia</b>. Just Emilia. It's nice to meet you.</p>

<p><b>EMILIA</b> — Thank you, for helping someone like me.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Someone like me?</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — It's no skin off my back. And your name is nice!</p>

<p><b>EMILIA</b> — Why would skin come off of your back?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — It's just an expression. It means don't worry! That goes double by the way for the negotiations, just stay here until I say it's alright.</p>

<p><b>EMILIA</b> — I will. Do your best in there.</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Will do!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>...</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>...</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>...</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>...okay, maybe the Narrator was more important than I gave Him credit for.</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>It feels weird taking over for Him but...</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>I gave Emilia a thumbs up and a smile before heading into the loot house, taking a lantern from Emilia with me that she said contains 'lagmite'.</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>For a while, I thought this world might've mostly had the same things on Earth but with different names like apples to appa but a fantasy world is a fantasy world after all.</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>It's dark in here. Pitch black. The air is stale and there's some kind of smell going on...</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Anyone in here?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>No response. No one here, probably. Knowing that doesn't make it seem any less creepy. Maybe they left the insignia. I should look around and grab it before leaving.</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>The floorboards are creaky and that smell... ugh! It's getting stronger the farther I go. I'm gonna try and hurry up.</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>There doesn't seem to be anything valuable over in this corner... small boxes, jars, blades... they have wooden tags on them but I can't read the text, of course. Still, it looks like the items are getting bigger and more expensive the farther I go. The insignia had a jewel in it right? It must be deeper inside, maybe in the back.</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>I hurry up further when-</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Hm? Did I step in something? Squish? And the smell! Is this w-</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Uh-</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — What... is this?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — Ah?</p><center>

<p>
        <i>The thoughts of the boy from another world turn to nothing more than visceral, wordless disgust and horror at the sight of a corpse. A large old man with a torn-up neck and a severed arm. He had stepped in his blood. The boy began to scream. As he did, his surroundings dropped a half dozen degrees in an instant and the blood touching him had begun to freeze solid. Not that he noticed this in his own panic.</i>
      </p></center>

<p><b>SULTRY WOMAN</b> — I'm sure you heard me when I told you to stay. But now I have no choice at all. Yes, nothing to do about it now.</p><center>

<p>
        <i>Instinctually, he turns towards the voice from the darkness. This was his folly. He was stuck: hard. Hard enough to be sent flying against the wall across the room. The lantern in his hand went flying in the other direction, smashing into tiny pieces and leaving the room engulfed in blackness.</i>
      </p></center>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — H-hot...</p>

<p><b>SULTRY WOMAN</b> — Once again, you have that strange scent. It's the kind of scent that numbs the senses and takes away all the heat from your body. You wouldn't happen to be from Gusteko would you?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>It's so warm... it's the opposite of last time... it hurts. It burns! It's burning me from the inside out! A-ahhh, I don't want to die. I don't want to die!</i></p>

<p><b>SULTRY WOMAN</b> — Well, your answer wouldn't change what I have to do would it? Alas, I'll just have to pry the mystery from your guts then won't I?</p><center>

<p>
        <i>The boy opens his mouth to shout but only blood comes out. As some of it freezes on its way out, it gets stuck and he begins to choke on icy blood. Between the blood loss and the darkness, he can make out only a hazy view of his nearby surroundings. But it's clear that he's lying in a pool of blood.</i>
      </p></center>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>All this blood... is mine?</i></p><center>

<p>
        <i>He looks down, from his angle, towards where his lower torso would be. It was there, though near entirely sliced through. The heat he had felt had subsided and he realized silently that he had merely confused pain for heat. Now only the uncaring cold remains.</i>
      </p></center>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>My stomach... she tore open my stomach...</i></p><center>

<p>
        <i>The door to the loot house opens and its next and last visitor enters.</i>
      </p></center>

<p><b>EMILIA</b> — Subaru? What's wrong? Are you alright?</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>No, Emilia! Don't come in, get out of here!</i></p><center>

<p>
        <i>But he could no longer speak and so she could not heed his silent warning. Even so...</i>
      </p></center>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>I won't let... I won't let you die. I don't want to see any more people die in front of me and especially not you!</i></p><center>

<p>
        <i>He wills his arm to move with all the meager strength he had left. He points it away from where the door to the loot house was and wills the pieces of his consciousness to return to work.</i>
      </p></center>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — I- how am I back h-</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — <b>WHY ARE YOU BLEEDING OUT.</b></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Help me, the ice! We'll do the ice thing again!</i></p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — No, fuck that you're explai-</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Do you want to die without having done anything of value again?!</i></p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — ...fuck, fine, screw it, we'll talk later.</p>

<p><b>VOICE OF THE CHEATED</b> — Haaaaaaaa!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Haaaaaa-</i></p><center>

<p>
        <i>A cascade of ice bursts from his palm, only barely controlled, it nearly grazes the lady he is trying to protect. However, it strikes true, engulfing half the loot house's first floor in an icy prison.</i>
      </p></center>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Yes!</i></p>

<p><b>EMILIA</b> — Subaru!</p><center>

<p>
        <i>The silver-haired lady shakes off her shock at the sheer level of destruction created by the boy to find said boy bleeding out. She dashed to his side in a panic and began to use healing magic, her hands glowing with energy over the two halves of his body, near-bisected.</i>
      </p></center>

<p><b>EMILIA</b> — You're going to be fine, you're going to be fine. I'm going to heal you so just stay with me!</p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Emilia...</i></p><center>

<p>
        <i>The boy's massive wound begins to mend, slowly. Too slowly. He's been choking this whole time and the edges of his vision fade.</i>
      </p></center>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>It's too late, Emilia... but at least... I saved you...</i></p>

<p><b>SULTRY WOMAN</b> — My, how lovely, I thought I was going to die.</p><center>

<p>
        <i>A thrown blade passes through the silver-haired lady's abdomen. She lets out a dying gasp as she falls to the ground limp. Her blood and the boy's mix together on the loot house's floorboards.</i>
      </p></center>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>No!</i></p><center>

<p>
        <i>In an act of either cosmic irony or compassion, her hand had landed on top of his and became intertwined with his own. He squeezes her hand, as if he could will the both of them back to the realm of the living by pulling them both from the river Styx. The girl's hand squeezes back.</i>
      </p></center>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Damn it, damn it, damn it!</i></p><center>

<p>
        <i>Two lonely singers cry out in grief at their beloved's fall. One grasps for another's hand as they perish, dreaming of a world where the hand they hold is warm. The other can only watch from their window, pulling desperately at their fetters. But there is no respite for either one.</i>
      </p></center>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>Just wait... I'll definitely...</i></p>

<p><b>NATSUKI SUBARU</b> — <i>s-save... you...</i></p><center>

<p>
        <i>Everything goes dark, and he dies.</i>

<p>Lots of direct quotes from Slay the Princess in this chapter but I couldn't get more in-character for the narrator than, well, quoting the narrator. As the story diverges and old questions stop popping back up, the frequency of direct quotes should dwindle.</p>

<p>I want to ask, do you prefer this style of chapter length where it keeps going until Subaru dies like how it works in Slay the Princess or would it be better to chop up the full StP-style chapters into smaller ones? The former I think is nicer to read but leads to (more) uneven updates where I might take anywhere from a week to a month if the chapter demands it. The latter means more consistent chapters but breaking it up might hurt the experience of reading.</p>

<p>Oh and one other question, what voice do you think will show up next chapter?</p>
